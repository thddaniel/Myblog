###**How to create a budget:**###

- The basic model to start building a budget:
    -Money in
    -Money out
- Between the two we have discretionary funds:
    -Cash
    -Savings
    -Investments

A budget plan would look like this:

Discretionary fund is the extra money you have, after paying all your expense. You can spend all of it for current fun, or you can save it/ invest for future.

###**How to start a budget plan:**###

- First step:Creating a saving account in your local bank, it can be the cash reserves for emergency, or funds for buying a house, etc. It earns more interests than checking account.
- College might have credit union, which charges lower fees and have higher interest rates.Also, not every bank is the same; some might have higher fees, fewer transaction times, and other different policies.

Some other key points in managing budgeting and spending your money:

- Money are meant to be spend-wisely. How you spend it will determine whether your wealth will increase or shrink.
- Fixed expenses are the point to start counting, but they can also be adjusted. E.g. you can choose which kind of house you want to live in, and therefore how much rent you will pay.
- You can use spreadsheet to plan budget, and there are also tools online.
- The more important work is not creating a budget, but sticking to it.
