Politeness is "having or showing behaviour that is respectful and considerate of other people."

Politeness is better than logic.You can often persuade when you cannot convince.And I think what he meant by that is that if you’re polite, people will listen and take your arguments, ideas, opinions seriously. They  may even change their own behaviour and do what you’d like them to do!

1. Don't impose.
2. Give options.
3. Make the other person feel good.

#Principle Of Polite English 
##When giving your opinion, show some uncertainty

Uncertainty phrases:

- I think
- I believe
- I guess
- I suppose
- I expect

Phrase can come at the beginning or the end.

e.g. "**I think** she works in a bank","She works in a bank, **I think**."

## Use question tags and indirect questions.

`Question tags`:  e.g. "She works in a bank, **doesn't she**?"

Rising Intonation:

- Asking for confirmation 
- Suggest uncertainty

Falling Intonation:

- Inviting agreement
- Suggest certainty


`Direct questions`: sometimes sound too pushy. e.g. "Where does she work?"

`Indirect Questions`: e.g. "I was wondering if you knew where she worked?" or "Do you mind if I asked you where she worked?"

**Summary: Use question tags with a rising intonation. Use indirect questions, but don't overuse them.**


##Credit the other person with some knowledge and intelligence.

e.g. 

"**Of course**, she works in a bank, **you know**." 

"**Of course**, **as you know**, she works in a bank." 

"**As I'm sure you know**, she works in a bank."

##Sensitive correction is vital.

**Say sorry then correct.**

e.g. "I'm sorry, but she works in a school, not a bank."

**Give the other person the option of correcting their slip.**

e.g. "In a bank? Did you say she works in a bank?" or "In a bank? I thought she worked in a hospital."

##Show the other person that you are reluctant to disagree with them.

**Softening the disagreement and provide a reason** 

e.g. "I don't want to disagree, but I think we should take the train not the bus.I think it's faster and slightly cheaper."

- I don't want to complain but....
- I don't want to be difficult but....
- I hope you don't mind my saying so, but....
- I'm sorry,but...
- I'm afraid that...
- I'd like to agree with you but....
- Perhaps, it would be better to...
- It's your choice but....
- I may be wrong but....

##Avoid direct commands.
e.g.

"Could you help me with my suitcase, please?"

"Would you be able to help me with my suitcase?"

"I wonder if you could help me with my suitcase?"

"Do you think you could (possibly) help me with my suitcase?"

"You wouldn't help me with my suitcase, would you?"

"Is there any chance..."


**Give them a hint** : "My goodness. this suitcase is so heavy! I'm going to break my back lifting it!"


#Common situation

##Common Polite Phrases

"Thanks for your help." "You're welcome."

"Can I take a seat?" "Go ahead. Be my guest."

"Thanks for having me." "My pleasure."

"I'm get the bill." "That's very kind of you."

"Happy birthday. Here's a little something for you." "Oh, you shouldn't have"

##Complaining Politely
"There seems to be a problem with my order. I think I asked for chicken not steak."

"Sorry to bother you but I think I asked for chicken not steak."

**For serious complaints it's usually best to use direct language but try to avoid swearing!**

##Direct Offers
"Let me buy you a drink."

"Let me help you."

"You must let me pay for this."

"Promise me you'll come to the party."

"You will come to dinner, won't you?"


**Strong offers can be declined or refused, but we usually explain why.**

"That's OK. I can manage by myself."

"I'd love to come but I'm busy on Friday."

##Indirect Offers

**Weak offers/invitations are more difficult to accept or reject directly.**

"Are you busy next week?"

"Are you a fan of opera?"

"You are not free next week, are you?"
