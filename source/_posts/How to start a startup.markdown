网易公开课：[如何创业](http://v.163.com/special/opencourse/startup.html) Stanford CS183B

**Outcome** =`Idea` x `Product` x `Teams` x `Execution` x `Luck`(random # between 0 and 10,000)

**Four critical parts:**

#**A Great Idea**
It includes the size and growth of the market,the growth strategy for company,the defensibility strategy and so on.

- Even though plans themselves are worthless,to exercise a planning is really valuable.
- You need to build a business that is difficult to replicate.
- Startup should feel like an important mission.
- You want an idea that turns into a monopoly,but you can't get monopoly in a big market right away.You have to find a small market in which you can get a monopoly, and then quickly expand.

- This is why the best ideas often look terrible at the beginning.
- You need a market that's going to be big in ten years.
- More important than starting any particular startup is getting to know a lot of potential co-founders.
- The importance of thinking about what customers want, and thinking about the demands of the market.
<br>

#**Building a Great Product**
Broad definition: It includes customer support and copyright explaining the product.Anything involved in your customers interaction with what you build for them. 

- Great Ideas turn to great product. A great product is the secret to long term growth hacking.
- Build something users love.Its better to build something that a small number of users love, than to build something that a large number of users like. 
- Start with something simple. Its much much easier to make a great product if you have something simple.
- Talk to users. You need some users to help with the feedback cycle.The way to get those users is manually.You should go recruit them by hand. Don't do things like buy google ads in the early days to get initial users.

- You should make this feedback loop as tight as possible.The best companies usually have the tightest feedback loops.

<br>
#**Team**
Cofounder relationships are among the most important in the entire company. The number one cause of early death for startups is cofounder blowups.

-  It's better to have no cofounder than to have a bad cofounder, but it's still bad to be a solo founder. Two or three cofounders seems to be about perfect. 
-  At the beginning, you should only hire when you desperately need to,because the cost of getting an early hire wrong is really high. 
-  Do not hire mediocre people.Mediocre people at huge companies will cause some problems, but it won't kill the company. A single mediocre hire within the first five will often in fact kill a startup.

**There are three things I look for in a hire.** 

- Are they smart? 
- Do they get things done? 
- Do I want to spend a lot of time around them?

You can learn a lot about all three of these things in an interview but the very best way is working together, so ideally someone you've worked together with in the past and in that case you probably don't even need an interview. If you haven't, then I think it's way better to work with someone on a project for a day or two before hiring them. 

For most of the early hires that you make at a startup, experience probably doesn't matter that much and you should go for aptitude and belief in what you're doing. 

- good communication skills tend to correlate with hires that work out.
- Good communication skills
- Manically determined
- Pass the animal test
- Would feel comfortable reporting to them

**You've hired the best - now keep them around!**
You have to make sure your employees are happy and feel valued.

> Dan Pink talks about these three things that motivate people to do great work:   
 autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

Firing people fast when it's not working.

#**Execution**
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thddaniel/Myblog/master/image/startup/3.jpg)

Execution gets divided into two key questions. 

- Can you figure out what to do ?
- Can you get it done?
<br>    *1.Focus*
    - what are you spending time and money on?
    - what are the two or three most important things?
    
One of the hardest parts about being a founder is that there are a hundred important things competing for your attention every day. And you have to identify the right two or three, work on those, and then ignore, delegate, or defer the rest.You only get points when you make something the market wants. So if you work really hard on the wrong things, no one will care.

  
*2.intense* 

- Startups only work at a fairly intense level. 
- The secret to start up success is extreme focus and extreme dedication. 
- Startups are not the best choice for work life balance and that's sort of just the sad reality.
The good news here is that a small amount of extra work on the right thing makes a huge difference. One example that I like to give is thinking about the viral coefficient for a consumer web product. How many new users each existing user brings in. If it's .99 the company will eventually flatline and die. And if it's 1.01 you'll be in this happy place of exponential growth forever.
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thddaniel/Myblog/master/image/startup/4.jpg)
    So this is one concrete example of where a tiny extra bit of work is the difference between success and failure. 
    
<br>
**The momentum and growth are the lifeblood of startups.**

> A good way to keep momentum is to establish an operating rhythm at the company early. Where you ship product and launch new features on a regular basis. Where you’re reviewing metrics every week with the entire company. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thddaniel/Myblog/master/image/startup/5.jpg)

Don’t worry about a competitor at all, until they’re actually beating you with a real, shipped product. Press releases are easier to write than code, and that is still easier than making a great product. So remind your company of this, and this is sort of a founder’s role, is not to let the company get down because of the competitors in the press.
